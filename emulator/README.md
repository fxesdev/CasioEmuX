The `build.bat` was modified to work on MSYS2 MinGW64. You will need to install the [`mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc`](https://packages.msys2.org/package/mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc) package
to get g++, which is needed to build the program. Since it uses g++, building may take some time.

You can modify `build.bat` as needed to make it work with different environments and compilers. Or, you can change the build system entirely, but that won't be mentioned here.
